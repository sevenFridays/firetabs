You can later open tab list or share it with someone else (even without Firetabs installed) - it's just single plain html file\r\n* You can remove some tabs (or whole windows) from tab list (red \"x\") if you don't want to see them (they will not be saved either)\r\n* In list tabs are grouped by windows they belong to for easy navigation\r\n* Tab url is shown as additional hint (in case document title is empty or/and not very informative)\r\n\r\n##Install\r\n\r\nFiretabs is very young project and hosted only at <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/firetabs-extension/downloads/list\">Google Code</a> for now, it cannot be found at addons.mozilla.org.\r\nUnfortunately, Google Code forces all downloads to open in \"Save as...\" dialog, effectively disabling single-click extension install.\r\nUntill Firetabs moves to its own server without this restriction, it has to be installed manually. \r\n\r\nTo install extension manually:\r\n\r\n1. Download .xpi file from Downloads section\r\n2. Open Firefox Extension Manager: Tools --> Addons\r\n3. Click drop-down box in top right corner (near search field) and select \"Install addon from file\"\r\n4. Point to downloaded .xpi file.\r\n\r\n##Develop\r\nYou are welcome to contribute!\r\n\r\nIn order to build binary distribution you must have <a href=\"http://www.gradle.org\">gradle</a> installed.\r\nTo build .xpi execute\r\n\r\n    gradle xpi\r\n\r\n##Downloads\r\nAll downloadable files are available on <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/firetabs-extension/downloads/list\">Google Code project page</a> (GitHub abandoned Downloads support for new projects).\r\n\r\n##License\r\n   Copyright 2013 sunlaud\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
