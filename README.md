This branch contains binary distribution of Firetabs latest version.  
It is needed for convenient initial addon install via Firefox popup using tricky javascript in conjunction with GitHub REST API.  
Binary file here in no way should not be treated as abuse of GitHub 'no downloads' policy since it's just 4Kb, and only the last
version is kept here (thus just one file).
