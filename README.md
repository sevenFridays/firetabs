##About
Firetabs is a Firefox extension that shows names and urls of all your open tabs in one html document (opened in new tab).

__No need to keep that hundred of tabs opened any more!__

##Features
* Every entry in tab list is hyperlink to page loaded in tab, so you can easily (re)open your tabs just from tab list
* Tab list can be saved just as regular html file (File -> Save Page As, just make sure to choose "Web Page, complete" as output format). You can later open tab lits or share it with someone - it's just single plain html file
* You can remove some tabs (or whole windows) from tab list (red "x") if you don't want them to be saved
* In list tabs are grouped by windows they belong to for easy navigating
* Tab url is shown as additional hint (in case document title is empty or/and non-informative)
